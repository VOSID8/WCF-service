Detailed Explanation
LookupController

Description: The main entry point for all lookup-related HTTP requests.
Responsibilities:
Receives requests.
Logs the requests and responses.
Calls the LookupHelper to process the business logic.
Returns JSON responses.
LookupHelper

Description: Acts as a thin controller, separating the business logic from the controller.
Responsibilities:
Applies business logic.
Manages caching by interacting with the CacheProvider and CacheKeyGenerator.
Calls the LookupRepository to retrieve data from the database.
ILookupRepository

Description: Defines the interface for the repository.
Responsibilities:
Specifies the methods for data access (e.g., GetBUKScorpioProductPaged, GetSystemConfiguration, etc.).
LookupRepository

Description: Implements the ILookupRepository interface.
Responsibilities:
Contains the actual data access logic.
Uses Entity Framework to interact with the DataContext for database operations.
DataContext

Description: The Entity Framework context.
Responsibilities:
Manages database connections and access.
Defines DbSets for each entity (e.g., TS_GPTBUKScorpioProduct, TS_GPTSYSC, etc.).
Database

Description: The database storing all application data.
Responsibilities:
Stores data in tables like TS_GPTBUKScorpioProduct, TS_GPTSYSC, etc.
CacheProvider

Description: Manages caching to improve performance.
Responsibilities:
Handles caching logic to store and retrieve data.
Ensures data consistency with locking mechanisms.
CacheKeyGenerator

Description: Generates unique keys for caching.
Responsibilities:
Creates unique cache keys based on method names and parameters.
PaginatedList.cs

Description: Provides paging functionality for lists.
Responsibilities:
Implements paging logic to handle large datasets efficiently.
Data Flow
Client Request: A client application sends an HTTP request to LookupController.
Controller Logic: LookupController receives the request and calls the LookupHelper.
Helper Logic: LookupHelper applies business logic, checks the cache, and calls the LookupRepository if necessary.
Data Access: LookupRepository fetches data from the DataContext.
Database Interaction: DataContext interacts with the database to retrieve or store data.
Caching: CacheProvider caches the data to improve future request performance.
Paging: PaginatedList handles paging for large datasets.
Response: LookupHelper sends the data back to LookupController, which then returns it as a JSON response to the client application.
